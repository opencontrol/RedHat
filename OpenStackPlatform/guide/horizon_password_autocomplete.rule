rule_id: horizon_password_autocomplete
primary_group: horizon
severity: medium

description: |
    Check that password autocomplete is set to off.

ocil:
    clause: password autocomplete is set to off
    description: |
        Set the parameter password_autocomplete in /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings is set to on

rationale: |    
    Common feature that applications use to provide users a convenience is to cache the password locally in the browser (on the client machine) and
    having it pre-typed in all subsequent requests. While this feature can be perceived as extremely friendly for the average user, at the same 
    time, it introduces a flaw, as the user account becomes easily accessible to anyone that uses the same account on the client machine and thus 
    may lead to compromise of the user account.
